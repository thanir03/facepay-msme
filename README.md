## 💼 Business Model

Our monetization is based on a **tiered subscription model** tailored to MSME needs:

| Plan    | Monthly Fee | Free Transaction Volume | Excess Fee |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |
| Starter | RM39        | RM10,000                | 2.0%       |
| Growth  | RM99        | RM30,000                | 2.0%       |
| Pro     | RM299       | RM100,000               | 2.0%       |

> 💳 Beyond the free transaction volume, a flat 2.0% fee is applied.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FacePay MSME app**: Handle onboarding for MSME to register their business to accept payments via face from customers
2. **FacePay Mobile app**: Handle user account registration and multiple bank accounts, e-wallets and cards integration
3. **FacePay Backend Server**: Handle all the transaction with the integration with Paynet API and face recognition based transactions
4. **MongoDB Database** : Single source of truth for all the transactions and account details & Store Faces into embeddings format using vector store
5. **FaceNet** : Used facial recognition and generate highly discriminative face embeddings for faces

### Transaction Flow with FacePay

1. **Initiate Payment Request**

   - Merchant launches the payment scanner on the FacePay MSME app.
   - User is prompted to stand in front of the camera.

2. **Capture Live Face**

   - App captures the user's live face image or short video using the device camera.

3. **Liveliness Detection**

   - Liveliness check is performed to ensure the face is real (e.g., blink detection, head movement).
   - Prevents spoofing using photos or masks.

4. **Generate Live Face Embeddings**

   - The live face image is converted into a face embedding (numerical vector).

5. **Match with Stored Embeddings**

   - The embedding is compared against all registered consumer embeddings in the vector database.
   - If similarity score is above threshold (e.g., cosine similarity ≥ 0.8), it's a valid match.

6. **Retrieve Consumer Account**

   - Based on matched embedding, the user's account ID and linked registered account details are retrieved.

7. **Process Payment**

   - Deduct the specified transaction amount from the user’s selected account.
   - Log the transaction (merchant ID, user ID, amount, timestamp).

8. **Send Confirmation**
   - Backend responds with transaction status (success or failure).
   - Merchant app displays "Payment Successful" or relevant error message.
   - Consumer receives a push notification of the transaction status.

## 🔒 Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**

   - **Face authentication** must be tied to **verified user accounts** via **eKYC (MyKad, Face)**.
   - Only **authorized merchants/devices** can initiate **face scan requests**.
   - Secure **device registration** to prevent rogue **POS terminals**.

2. **Biometric Security**

   - Use **anti-spoofing (liveness detection)** techniques to prevent replay or photo attacks.
   - **Facial embeddings** are generated on-device and verified securely.
   - Check more than **100+ facial points** to verify user.

3. **Data Integrity**

   - Face match and transaction logs are **signed** and timestamped to ensure auditability.
   - Device-to-server communication uses HTTPS with mutual TLS (mTLS) for integrity.

4. **Privacy**

   - Facial data is hashed and **stored securely** using **encryption-at-rest (AES-256)**.
   - Only **authorized services** can access facial embeddings through scoped tokens.

5. **Payment Authorization**

   - Face match alone is not sufficient; Biometric reconfirmation is required for large transactions.
   - Users are notified in real-time for each face-based payment.

6. **Device Security**

   - Edge devices (camera-enabled POS systems) are **locked down with kiosk mode** and remote kill switch.
   - **Device tamper detection** and logging are in place.

7. **Compliance**

   - Follows **PDPA (Malaysia), GDPR (EU)**, and other relevant biometric privacy laws.
   - User consent is **mandatory** before enrollment and each biometric transaction.
